Do's and Don'ts for mastering technical/coding interviews-

DO’s:

✅UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM: Carefully read and comprehend the problem statement before attempting to solve it. Seek from the interviewer if needed.

✅COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY: Clearly explain your thought process, ask questions, and seek feedback during the interview. Effective communication is crucial to showcase your understanding and problem-solving abilities.

✅THINK OUT LOUD: Walk the interviewer through your approach, explaining why you are choosing a particular solution or algorithm. This demonstrates your reasoning skills and allows the interviewer to follow your thought process.

✅USE EXAMPLES: When explaining complex concepts, use real-world examples or analogies to make your explanations clearer.

✅TEST & DEBUG: After writing your code, run sample test cases to ensure its correctness. Be proactive in identifying and fixing any bugs in your solution.

DON’Ts:

❌DON'T RUSH: Avoid the urge to jump into coding immediately. Take your time to comprehend the problem and outline your strategy.

❌DON'T PANIC: If you encounter a challenging problem, stay calm. Panic can cloud your thinking and lead to errors.

❌DON'T IGNORE CONSTRAINTS: Ensure that your solutions consider time and space constraints mentioned in the problem statement. Ignoring them can result in incomplete or inefficient solutions.

❌DON'T IGNORE EDGE CASES: Don't skip over edge cases or corner scenarios. Handling edge cases shows attention to detail and robust problem solving.

❌DON'T DISMISS ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS: Acknowledge alternative approaches, even if you prefer a particular one. Be open to discussing and learning from different perspectives.
