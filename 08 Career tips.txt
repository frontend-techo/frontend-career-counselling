Tip 01 
========================================================================
Not all job openings are posted online.
→ Many openings are filled internally by reference.
→ Hence, having a strong network is super important.

Network -->> Gets you internal reference.
Resume ->> Gets you shortlisted for interview.
Performance in interviews ->> Gets you the job.

→ Only Network doesn't get you the job.
→ Only Resume doesn't get you the job.
→ Only interview prep doesn't get you the job.

All three are equally important part of the process.

Job search is a long process.

Have patience.

Don't expect results overnight 🚀

Tip 03 
=========================================================================
Don't leave your current job now, the market is not really good these days!

vs

Don't suffer at a toxic workplace. There is always a job available for the right candidate irrespective of the market conditions.

-----------------------------------

If you choose option 1 - You are right.

If you choose option 2 - You are right.

We all convince ourselves one way or another.

Tip 04 
================================================================================
Manager's Salary = 18 Lakhs
His Team Member's Salary = 12 Lakhs

After getting job offer from another company, team member's salary = 19 Lakhs.

This is pretty shocking for the manager.

But this is a very common scenario today.

It happened because the manager has not changed his project/ tech stack/ company for last 9+ years.

While the team member hopped 2 jobs in the last 5 years and is tech savy/ in demand.

Of course, everyone has different priorities at different phases of their lives.

But IT Professionals with 15+ years of experience in the Service Industry need to understand...

- The job world has changed a lot.
- Being laid back doesn't help.
- Being in the comfort zone is dangerous.
- There is no alternative to continuous learning.
- Not taking any risk is in itself a bigger risk.

Time to reinvent yourself is Here and Now 🚀🚀🚀


Tip 05 
====================================================================================================

Secrets to building great teams:

1. Hire best people under you, so that they hire best people under them. You can't expect average people to hire great people.

2. You earn RESPECT from your team only when you help them do their work. Be a problem solver for your team. Don't be someone who just gives orders.

3. Micromanage those who need Micromanagement. Give a free hand to those who are self driven. Your leadership style can't be same for everyone you deal with.

Tip 06 
====================================================================================================

Example: Your hiring budget = 8-10 LPA.
Smart manager hires at 7 LPA.

What does the manager gain?
- Saves 1 Lakh per year for the company!

What did the company lose?
- One more potential attrition in few months.
- Double the efforts and cost in hiring again.

Sooner or later people realize that they are underpaid.

Salary number is not that "Secret" anymore!

When they get to know, they just quit!

So pay the right salary at the time of hiring.

Tip 07 
====================================================================================================

No offer letter says employment is permanent.

It clearly states the terms of employment.

Either of the parties can terminate it with notice.

Then what the heck is Employee Loyalty?

A loyal employee is often more productive, contributes positively to the workplace culture, and shows commitment to the company's goals.

Loyal employees can become brand ambassadors, speaking positively about the company in external settings and referring potential employees or clients.

Loyalty does not mean...

→ You continue to work at a low salary.
→ You continue to work with a toxic boss.
→ You continue to drag yourself at work.

Employee loyalty isn't just about how long someone stays with a company. Most people get this wrong and continue to suffer.


Tip 08
====================================================================================================

After working for over 20 years here are a set of things which I realized drains most talented people out there.

1. Working and following a set of systems and processes that don't work.

2. They have to do things in a particular way just because that is the process.

3. They have to follow orders because their boss or someone senior wants it to be done that way.

4. Talented people feel super frustrated in an ecosystem where they are NOT heard.

5. Or where they are heard but told - "We can't do this change because we are following it for years".

6. Or when their senior says - "I don't control it. This is the way it works here. Let's just follow it".

7. Sometimes the need for a process was there some 15 years ago, but it is not needed anymore, but no one cares.

8. Sometimes the person who set the process for his/ her own reason has already left the company. But we still follow it blindly.

If talented people in your company are leaving check if one of the above is true.


Tip 09
====================================================================================================


You want a new job with 400% salary hike!
But are you ready to pay the price?

- Price of applying at 100+ companies.
- Price of patience when you don't get calls.
- Price of failing in multiple interview rounds.
- Price of getting ghosted at the last moment.
- Price of starting all over again.

Anything worthwhile comes along with a price!

Ask yourself are you ready to pay the price.

Do you have fire in you to cruise through it!

Get ready to go through the Grind my friends!

There isn't any shortcut 💯🔥🚀

Tip 10
====================================================================================================

Current Salary = 10 Lakhs.
Market Rate = 15 Lakhs.

First offer = 14 Lakhs.
Second offer = 16 Lakhs.

At this stage if you are smart you would pause and think of other factors like...

- Role and Responsibility
- Tech Stack/ Domain
- Long Term Prospects
- Company History/ Future Plans

But if you are greedy you would go for the third offer = 20 Lakhs.

If you know that the market rate is 15 Lakhs, then clearly the offer of 20 Lakhs is unrealistic.

If you go for this offer then be prepared for the consequences...

- May be unreasonable expectations
- May be two roles bundled into one
- May be short term project/ assignment
- May be history of hire and fire

No one would pay you 20 Lakhs when the market rate is 15 lakhs.

Do you smell a rat in such scenarios?

Remember you will need to pay a price!

Sooner or later 🚀🚀🚀


Tip 11
====================================================================================================

Rs 100K worth online course.
3 Months duration.
Makes you a product manager.
Offers placement assistance.

Now replace product management with data science or any other latest trending tool or tech.

In 3 months you can't become a product manager or data scientist unless you have relevant skills and experience from the past.

Before you join...

1. Learn from free resources.
2. Check course curriculum in detail.
3. Check current job descriptions for that role.
4. Now ask yourself are you fit for this role.
5. Will 3 months of learning get you the job.

Course counsellors will sell you as of it is the course created ONLY for you.

Don't just fall for placement assistance and high CTCs earned by other students.

Tip 12
====================================================================================================

Never chase higher CTC/ Salaries.

↳ Always chase better, newer, higher skills.
↳ Because without skill & role upgrade...
↳ CTCs will not peak beyond a point!

Some people try to show off how much they earn.

How much you earn is an outcome.

What matters is the skill/ effort you put.

The real value is not in showing off your CTC.

Your value is in the business impact you generate!

"Chase the right thing" 🙌💯🙏

Tip 13
====================================================================================================


Even 300% hike means nothing if the current CTC is low!

It is unfair to offer a CTC based on someone's current below market CTC.

You are hiring for skill, experience, expertise.

You are NOT hiring because their current CTC is low.

If you are a decision maker, be the agent of change!

Do the right thing!

Tip 14
====================================================================================================



Salary number is not that "Secret" anymore!

→ Job descriptions may NOT have this info.

↳ But many websites publish this info.
↳ Even if it is not accurate.
↳ You get to know average, high, low salary range.
↳ Across locations, grades, experience, companies.

So, people know that they are underpaid.

If you don't fix their salary, they will just leave!

→ It is high time managers ACCEPT this fact.

Because...

↳ If you lose one talented employee for salary concern
↳ You spend double the time, money and energy on...
↳ Hiring a Replacement and Training them all over!

But some managers act penny-wise and dollar-foolish.

Not sure if they don't get this point or if it's their Ego?


Tip 15
====================================================================================================

→ First job may pay you 3.2 Lakhs/ Year.
→ Second job may pay you 6.5 Lakhs/ Year.
→ Third job may pay you 11.8 Lakhs/ Year.
→ Fourth job may pay you 20 Lakhs/ Year.

So on and so forth.

- But at some point you will reach a peak.
- Beyond which there is no hike unless...
- You shift to a newer skillset/ role/ domain.

Before you reach that peak...

Check...

→ How to survive / grow beyond this point?
→ How many more years are ahead of you?
→ How have others survived/ grown?

The younger generation will always ...

↳ Be able to do more or same work...
↳ At a much lower cost.
↳ Therefore we cannot afford to be complacent.

Need to keep moving.

Today, Tomorrow and Every Single Day!


Tip 16
====================================================================================================

Salary = 7 Lakhs.
↳ Working in a comfort zone.
↳ Not learning new things.
↳ Not building any network.
↳ Just laid-back life.
↳ Got fired in a layoff.
↳ Life ahead = Full of struggle.

Now consider this... 👇 👇👇

Salary = 7 Lakhs.
↳ Working in a comfort zone.
↳ But kept learning new things.
↳ Passed certifications.
↳ Built a solid online and offline network.
↳ Got fired in a layoff.
↳ And got a new job offer within a month.
↳ Life ahead = Better job with salary hike.

→ What you do while in the Comfort Zone matters a lot!

Tip 17
====================================================================================================

Actions and habits that make you stress free...

1. If your office starts at 9 AM, then...
→ Start your work at 9 AM.
→ 10 minutes past 9 is late.

2. If someone sets up a meeting during lunch time,
→ Tell them you can't meet as you need to have lunch.

3. If someone sets up meeting at 6 PM. 
→ Tell them you can't attend
→ Because you have to go home.

4. Someone gives you a task just around lunch time or
at 5.45 PM and expects you to get it done within an hour

→ Do it only if it is a matter of life and death. 
→ Tell them you won't do this again.

5. If a meeting is supposed to get over at 11.30 AM, then
→ At 11.30 AM tell them you have other work to do. 
→ Don't hide behind an excuse ...
→ I have another meeting.

6. You get a meeting invite for 8 PM, tell them you
→ Can't attend because it is family time. 
→ Unless you are working in a shift model.

In short,

→ Be punctual and disciplined.

→ Don't work during your lunch hours.

→ Don't work while driving.

→ Don't get dragged in extended meetings.

→ Respect your family time.

→ Check if you entertain too many last minute requests.

Work with dedication but set boundaries 🚀🚀🚀

Tip 18
====================================================================================================

1. You prepare your Resume.
2. Start applying
3. Get an interview call
4. Prepare for interview
5. Fail in the Nth interview round


Tip 19
====================================================================================================

Don't leave your current job now, the market is not really good these days!

This is one advice which is given for free.

Mostly given by people who have NOT searched for a job since the ice age 😂

But they just say what Everyone else is saying.

Of course, timing the market is important.

Understanding the market pulse is important.

But just believing some random opinions is not going to help.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember job search is a test of patience and it requires a specific skillset.

Here is what you need...

➡️ Resume Optimization
➡️ Cold Email Writing
➡️ LinkedIn Optimization
➡️ Analyzing Job descriptions
➡️ Job portal Alerts
➡️ Writing personalised messages
➡️ Interview Preparation
➡️ Understanding hiring processes
➡️ Networking with right people

Remember:

1. There is always a job opening available for the right candidate!

2. Not all job openings are published online. A lot is closed by internal and influential references.

Hope this helps.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

P.S: Let's help each other by networking.

If you are searching for a job then add a comment 👇

If you are hiring then add a comment 👇

If you are a Coach and help people find jobs, go ahead use the comment section 👇

If you are none of these just repost and help others 🙏

Tip 20
====================================================================================================

If your skills are in demand, you're never truly jobless.

If you are underpaid, it is okay to switch multiple jobs.

If you can lead without authority, titles become irrelevant.

If you practice active listening, you'll be a better manager.

If your work can be done remotely, you don't need to go office.

If you have 15+ years of experience, the degree doesn't matter.



Tip 21
====================================================================================================

- We will get back to you.
- Managment will decide.
- Awaiting approval.
- It's under review.
- Currently in deliberation.
- We'll circle back soon.
- It's on the agenda.
- Awaiting feedback.
- Decision pending.
- Let's table this for now.
- Review in progress.
- We'll revisit shortly.

If your patience is being tested by these statements then please understand that the answer is a big bold "No".

Don't hope against hope for a Yes.

Sometimes we need to read between the lines.

Tip 22
====================================================================================================

- 250 Applicants applied for this job.
- Out of which 10-15 candidates may be interviewed.
- At least 2 to 7 interview rounds.
- Because companies want to select the best fit.

Similarly,

- A candidate applies for 50 positions.
- May get interview calls from 5-7 companies.
- Goes through multiple interview rounds.
- Intent is to select the best company/ offer.

Both sides want the best fit.

Both sides invest tons of hours in the process.

But at the end mostly things don't work out because of mismatch in salary expectations.

If companies want to know the candidate salary expectations on day 1 then why can't they publish the salary rage/ pay scale/ pay grade for the position on the job board/ job description.

If companies start to publish the salary information, it will save a lot of time, energy and efforts on both sides.


Tip 23
====================================================================================================

Never forget those seniors who...
- Reviewed your first email draft
- Prepped you for 1st appraisal meeting
- Saved you from client escalation
- Reviewed and fixed your code
- Tipped you on how to ask for salary hike

and above all...

Patiently listened to your personal problems.

All help without the "manager or lead" title.

Respect for those who lead from the front.

Without worrying about job titles 💯🙌🙏

Tip 24
====================================================================================================

When you find someone smarter than you...

- Don't play politics with them
- Don't try to pull them down
- Don't run away from them
- Don't compete with them in unhealthy way

Instead...

Try and learn from them.

Try and work with them.

Try and build association with them.

Why?

Because remember they are smarter than you!

Tip 25
====================================================================================================

To get the right Answers, you need to ASK the right Questions 💯🔥🚀

Tip 26
====================================================================================================

If you are not making new mistakes, you are probably working in your comfort zone.

Time for some self reflection.

Tip 27
====================================================================================================

Make mistakes but new ones!

Tip 28
====================================================================================================

1. Java expert with 8 years' experience making 12 Lakhs.
2. Java expert with 8 years' experience making 20 Lakhs.

Both with same skills and same level of expertise.

Then why so much difference?

Reasons:

A. Person 2 works for a Tech giant.

B. And he changed multiple jobs in last 8 years.

Person 1 worked for the same IT Service company for 8 years!

Truth is simple but strange!

Tip 29
====================================================================================================

I spent over Rs 2 Lakhs in my 40s to learn the following skills:

1. Blogging.
2. Freelancing.
3. Copy Writing.
4. Video Editing.
5. LinkedIn Growth.
6. YouTube Growth.
7. Online Coaching.
8. Digital Marketing.
9. Digital Course Creation.
10. Building Online Communities.

Reskilling and Upskilling is a must.

Your age doesn't matter.

It is not just about the money.

A lot more is at stake!

Question is:

Are you ready to pay the price for Success?

Tip 30
====================================================================================================

23 July 2004 → I joined Zensar.

23 July 2023 → I am still with Zensar.

That's 19 Years!

I get these questions a lot...

Why I did not quit? What are the reasons?

I tell them, reasons are many, but if I have to pick just ONE reason...

Then it is the "People" I worked with.

To all my Seniors, Juniors, Team members, Coworkers, ex-Zensarians and Clients →

You are the reason why I turned up to work...Every Single Day!

Companies thrive on People, and I am fortunate to work with a great bunch of People!

Thank You Everyone 🙏

Tip 31
====================================================================================================

- Changing your job for money is not a crime!
- Switching job for better role is not a crime!
- Escaping a toxic workplace isn't a crime!
- Switching for better growth isn't a crime!
- Switching to pursue passion isn't a crime!
- Switching to learn new skills isn't a crime!
- Switching for work-life balance isn't a crime!
- Switching for a shorter commute isn't a crime!
- Switching for value-aligned culture isn't a crime!
- Switching for a supportive environment isn't a crime!

Everyone has unique challenges.
Everyone has unique solutions.

Don't let the world tell you what is right or wrong.

Usually, the people who say: 'Prefer Trust and Loyalty over Money' are the people who already have a lot of money in their bank account!

You do, what suits you, and your situation!

Agree?

Tip 32
====================================================================================================

Finally, I met someone who resigned because he predicted the layoffs. How?

He said there were strong signals...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Unclear future plans.
- Hiring and promotion freeze.
- Key employees or leaders leaving.
- Revenue and margin going down QoQ.
- Senior mgmt's focus on reducing cost.
- Lack of strong new business in pipeline.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learning: If you have a family to feed, don't be the last man standing on a sinking ship. Look for signals of the 'Storm' and Jump with a Lifeboat.


Tip 33
====================================================================================================

Never negotiate based on an offer you don't have in your hand.

Example : Company 1 gives you an offer of 10 lakhs per Annum.

Company 2 conducts 4 rounds of interviews and tells you verbally that they will release an offer of 12 lakhs per Annum.

Now based on this verbal offer from Company 2 ==> Don't go to company 1 and negotiate for more than 10 lakhs.

Because there is no guarantee that a verbal offer will convert into a formal offer on email.

And what if Company 1 reverts their offer of 10 lakhs once they realize that you are fishing around for more offers in the market.

Remember:

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush 🚀

Agree?

Tip 34
====================================================================================================

Current Salary = 3.2 Lakhs
Market Rate = 8 Lakhs
You expect = 6.5 Lakhs
IT Service MNC Offer = 4 Lakhs

IT Service MNC says => Our policy is 25% hike.

Enter Startups...

Startup offer = 8 Lakhs

Startup says => Hire the right talent.

👉 Pay them what they deserve.

👉 Don't look at their current salary.

👉 Offer more than 100% hike if in our budget.

Bigger Companies => Complex Process.

Smaller Companies => Simpler Process.



Tip 35
====================================================================================================

Advantages of working from office...

1. You make great relationships/ rapport.
2. Relationships lead to better opportunities.
3. Opportunities lead to better Career Growth.
4. It in turn reflects in your appraisal letter.
5. In the form of promotion or salary hike.

Exceptions:
1. Super talented people who can make equally good relationships working remotely.
2. Those individual performers who have super dependency due to niche reasons. They may not worry about building a rapport.

Those who don't agree with this, in comments, tell me if anyone ever made Career progress without having a good rapport with their 1 Up and 2 Up managers.

Of course skill, performance etc are the building blocks of making a solid rapport with your boss.

However, it is no rocket science to determine that "working in office" gives you "that little" advantage.

P.S: If you work remotely like me, that's fine, there are other priorities in life.

Tip 36
====================================================================================================

Many people are underpaid.
- They know this fact for sure.
- Their employer know this as well.
- It is not at all about their performance.
- But still they are immesely underpaid. Why?

Because of one of these reasons...

- They are laid back.

-.They under rate themselves.

- Their employers take them for granted.

- They tell themselves it's okay to be underpaid.

Remember no one in this world cares about your pay if you don't care for it yourself.

If you are underpaid, it is on you.

Not on someone else.

Go do something about it.

Take action.

Tip 38
====================================================================================================

Before you submit your Resume for any job opening:
- Get yourself in the shoes of the recruiter
- If you were the recruiter...
- Would you shortlist this Resume
- Analyze your resume critically

If you do this exercise, you will know...
- What all things you need to remove
- And what all stuff you need to add
- In order to make your resume right fit for the job.

99% of the times, this is a game of common sense.

Tip 39
====================================================================================================

- Job search is a half marathon.
- It Is not a sprint.
- Colorful resume may get you attention.
- But it may not get you the job.
-It is a game of patience and persistence.

In the market which is filled with negative vibes, we bring to you an audio event which will help you streamline and fast track your mid-career job search journey.

Tip 40
====================================================================================================

1 Job title means 1 role and 1 salary.

But at times...

1 job title may mean multiple roles and 1 salary.

Resulting into...

- Long working hours.
- A lot of responsibility.
- A bit of stress, anxiety.

This is gift wrapped to you as...

- Career Growth
- Next Promotion
- Ownership and Leadership

We know the flip side but we still go for it.

So can't blame the company every time.

Because you always have the option to say No.

Work life balance is more of a choice!


Tip 41
====================================================================================================

Why people fail?

- They prepare for interviews only one day before the interview call. Rest of the time they are busy watching OTT. 📺🍿

- They claim to network, but their LinkedIn is dormant, and they never follow up on introductions. 🤝💤

- They dream of promotions but do not actively improve their skills or take on additional responsibilities. 📈😴

- They want a salary hike but hesitate to negotiate or demonstrate their worth to the employer. 💰🙊

- They aspire to switch careers but refuse to step out of their comfort zone and explore new areas. 🔄🐢

Success is about consistency.

It's about doing the right thing, even when no one is watching or when it's not immediately beneficial.

Let's strive for success by being proactive and taking charge of our careers!


Tip 42
====================================================================================================


Never forget those colleagues who...
- Guided you through your first project
- Helped you navigate the office politics
- Shared their lunch when you forgot yours
- Covered for you when you needed to leave early
- Worked late hours with you to meet project deadlines

and importantly...

Were there for you, when you were new to the city, feeling homesick, or struggling to adjust.

All support without the "friend or family" tag.

Salute to those unsung heroes of the workplace.


Tip 43

Person 1 to Person 2: It has been 5 years since I changed my job, how is it going at your end?

Person 2: Nothing has changed Brother. After you left, I am at the same company, same client, same project, same building, same cubical, same salary (almost)

Person 1: Actually the same applies to me as well. I am working on the same things for last five years in this company.

Only saving grace is the 40% hike I got five years ago when I switched 🙆‍♂️. I think it's time for me to switch once more now.

Person 2: But bro there is recession right now.

Person 1: Recession, yes may be, but my company recently hired 100 people. So it is there only if you "Think" it is there 🙂

Dear LinkedIn, Have you ever met Person 1 or Person 2 in real?

Things which impact your appraisal hike/ promotion...
- Your relationship with your immediate boss
- Your relationship with your boss's boss
- Now wait, don't let your imagination fly.
- Here relationship means Work relationship.
- Nothing else.

That is,
- Are you the "Go to" person for them?
- Can they trust you to get the job done?
- Can they trust you with the most complex projects?

- This trust is not built in a day.
- It is built over a period.
- One transaction at a time.

So yes...

Becoming the "Go to" person is a hell lot of work.

Imagine...If you were the boss...

Wouldn't you want to hire such a "Go to" person?

I am sure you do.

We all do.

No wonder...

The "Go to" person always walks away with best salary hike and promotion

I make about 25LPA at 5 years experience. I crossed my 20LPA line at 4 years experience. I work for a startup which no one has ever heard of, so yes, you don’t have to work in Google, Amazon to get this figure.

I won’t say this is very easy to achieve. I know many who are still in 6–8LPA range in different companies. But I also know many in my job circle who are all in the same range as me or above.

So how easy was for me to get here? Well here’s a brief point by point history in order :

Joined as fresher to my current company for 2.5LPA.
Worked 12–16 hours daily for 2 years. Gained HUGE amount of technical knowledge.
Being a startup, I put forward my ideas, worked on different projects and got appreciated for my work.
I worked and put all my effort to make the company a success. We all did. So when the company became successful, we were valued. We had an hand in every piece of code built so we became very important. Our salaries grew. Work load got reduced, a good work-life balance now.
So this is how I got where I am now. Now let me tell you a contrast to this. A friend of mine joined my company as a fresher too. He didn’t like programming. While I enjoyed 12–16 hours of work, He didn’t. He said “Omg who works like this” and left the company within 6 months. He joined HCL for 3.2LPA. He loved it. Very less work, lot of time to enjoy. It’s been 6 years, now he’s in IBM making 6LPA. I make much more and I work quite less now. Even if he switches company he won’t get much more because that’s how much service company pay.

So in general you have two choices if you want to make more money in software Industry within few years:

Get placed in google, amazon, ola, flipkart etc which offer high salary even for freshers.
Work in a startup, work your ass off for 2–3 years. Gain a lot of knowledge and become extremely well sought after. Make jumps to other product companies and make good money.
If you chose MNCs like HCL, IBM, TCS, Infy I’m sorry. You will see this much salary very late in your career, if ever. Simply because the work here is mediocre which anyone can do. They would rather train a fresher to do that work than pay high amounts to experienced guys. Whereas in product company, knowledge is valued

There are three people in any Web Development team:

Front End Developer - Let's call him John
Back End Developer - Let's call him Dave
Web Designer - Let's call him Leo
John codes what you see on your screen when you visit a website.

This includes the buttons, text fields, forms and animations.

John doesn't design the website.

He doesn't choose the colors and the layout to use.

Leo does.

Leo creates a design for pages in an image format, and then John converts that image into live a page with code.

Dave's code handles all the data that is required by the application.

If John, Dave and Leo create a registration page for their website, here's what the process will look like:

Leo creates a design with a tool like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe InDesign.

This design is currently in Image format and is non-interactive. You cannot click any of the buttons or interact with the forms.

Leo, the Web Designer, sends this image file to the Front End Developer, John.

Now, John writes code that builds a real page that looks just like the one in the image.

At this stage, the page has a form that can be submitted, but if a user tries to submit the form, the data goes nowhere.

This is where Dave, the Back-End Developer, comes in. He writes some magical code that handles all the data that comes from the user when she submits the form.

Dave's code validates the data for errors like invalid email, empty password field, etc.

If Dave's code finds no validation errors in the data, the data is stored in the database.

Now, the user is able to login to the website.

The same process is followed for every page of a website.

I hope this answer helped. Let me know if you have any questions.
